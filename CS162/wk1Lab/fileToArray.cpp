// Program to read data from a file "data.txt" into a set of arrays (parallel arrays: date, low, high, rain, summary -- which can all be string arrays)
// Random Number Generator to fill an array with random integers
// Program to read data from a file into a set of arrays
// You can simply finish the two programs that we did together in class for full credit or just what we did together for partial credit
// Be sure to attach the .txt text data file, too, because your program requires that file to compile and run
// You are learning to submit everything together so in the future youÂ´ll remember to attach your data file with your program
 
// live lecture word of the day data types
