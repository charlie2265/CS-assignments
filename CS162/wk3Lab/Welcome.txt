Welcome to Charlie's Trivia for Fine Film ! 
In this game you will be asked very difficult questions about 
some of the greatest work of film art from the later part of 
the 20th century.
Each correct answer rewards a point and with the possiblity of 
a random movie theater prize. If you answer 1 question incorrectly
3 times you lose the game. But dont worry, culture can be 
learned and you can return to play again another time.  Good Luck!
